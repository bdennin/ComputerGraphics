# RayTracer
This is a ray tracer for producing realistic images involving spheres, discs, and light sources that I created in my Computer Graphics course at Westminster College.  More specifically, it also takes advantage of several techniques used in computer graphics, such as texture mapping, diffuse reflection, specular reflection, shading, and shadows. This program is implemented in Java, and uses an interface, and other object-oriented structures.  
In the main directory, you'll see several textures that were used to draw 3D representations of the 8 planets floating in our solar system.  The final project, which I created with this application, was an accurate model of the solar system.  You too, can have this picture, if you download this program and execute it.  Be warned though, the image is set to be a size of 40,000 by 40,000 pixels.  The idea behind this was to have a super realistic solar system.  A fun additional note:  I wrote the disc class specifically for measuring the accurate light reflection and distortion of Saturn's disc structure.
